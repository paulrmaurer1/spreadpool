Hey {{lose_first_name}}, unfortunately, your team {{team_l}} lost. Their opponent, {{team_w}}, was favored by {{spread}} 1/2 and won by the score of {{team_w_score}} - {{team_l_score}}. Incidentally, {{team_w}} is owned by {{win_short_name}}. Now would be a great time for that prank you've been meaning to pull on someone. :)
