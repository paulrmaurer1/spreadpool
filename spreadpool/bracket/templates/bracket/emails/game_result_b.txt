Hey {{lose_first_name}}, Woohoo! Your team {{team_l}} were {{spread}}1/2 underdogs vs. {{team_w}} and only lost {{team_w_score}} - {{team_l_score}}. That means you inherit {{team_w}} for the next round! Incidentally, {{team_w}} was owned by {{win_short_name}}. Perhaps a well thought out thank-you will help them overcome the sting. :)
