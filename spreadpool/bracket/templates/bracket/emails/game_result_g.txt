Hey {{lose_first_name}}, unfortunately, your team {{team_l}} was favored but lost the game vs. {{team_w}}. Despite being favored by {{spread}} 1/2 points, {{team_l}} lost by the score of {{team_w_score}} - {{team_l_score}}. Incidentally, {{team_w}} is owned by {{win_short_name}} ({{win_email}}). Perhaps congratulatory kudos are in order for their unprobable win. :)
