Hey {{first_name}},
Thanks for registering for the NCAA Spreapool 2024!

To confirm your entry, you registered with the following info:
Name: {{full_name}}
Number of Entries: {{num_entries}}
{% if mult_entry_type == "S" and num_entries > 1 %}
Your {{num_entries}} entries will be assigned to the Same bracket.
{% endif %}
{% if mult_entry_type == "D" and num_entries > 1 %}
Your {{num_entries}} entries will be assigned to the Different brackets.
{% endif %}
Thanks for registering!  You have until the Registration deadline to make any changes 
needed to your Registration settings. These include: the # of brackets, whether you want them in the Same or 
Different brackets, your registered First & Last name, and your email address. If you decide you don't want to participate, you can 
Login again and Delete your profile.

Shortly after the registration period closes, you will receive an email with your team assignments.  You'll get 4 teams, one per 
Region, assigned for each entry that you registered. Payment ($20/entry) will be owed once your teams are assigned. Then on each 
day during the Tournament , you will receive an email with the Spread and game date/time (ET) for each of your teams.

If you have any questions about how this all works, don't hesitate to reach out to me (paulrmaurer@yahoo.com) with any questions.

Regards,
Paul
